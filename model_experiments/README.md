## This folder is for model experiements. 
- I tried Qwen 1.5B with very basic prompting, and seems like the model performs quite well! 
- Use gradio for better representation (as ggle colab can't host local website:<)

## Follow up steps: 
- Data augmentation using free LLMs (GPT, deepseek, Gemini)
- Finetune model with those augmented data and save model checkpoint, load to local and run.
