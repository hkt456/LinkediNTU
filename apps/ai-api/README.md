# ai-api (FastAPI)

This directory contains the FastAPI app for AI or ML endpoints.

### Installation

We are currently using Poetry as the package manager for this project. To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

To activate the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Running the app

Haven't touched this part yet so of course it's not working. But the plan is to run the app using the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
