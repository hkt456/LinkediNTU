"Here's an improved version of the resume, tailored to the job description:\n\nMachine Learning Intern \nThales Solutions Asia, Singapore \nSeptember 2023 \u2013 January 2024 \n\n* Utilized PyTorch-compatible YOLOX models to develop and train object detection algorithms, achieving a 20% reduction in gate passing time for the SMRT system, showcasing expertise in deep learning and real-time image processing.\n* Developed and executed multiple object detection models, including YOLOv, with a focus on model accuracy and efficiency, achieving 72% accuracy and demonstrating proficiency in deep learning techniques.\n* Designed and implemented automated testing scripts for continuous model evaluation on video inputs, leveraging skills in on-device algorithm development, including video processing, frame extraction, and result logging, highlighting ability to work with real-time data and distributed systems.\n\nI made the following changes to better align the resume with the job description:\n\n1. Emphasized PyTorch compatibility to match the job requirement.\n2. Highlighted expertise in deep learning and real-time image processing to align with the job's requirements.\n3. Used keywords from the job description, such as \"object detection\", \"deep learning\", and \"real-time image processing\", to demonstrate relevance to the job.\n4. Changed the focus from specific models (YOLOX and YOLOv) to the skills and techniques used (object detection, model accuracy, and efficiency), to showcase a broader range of skills.\n5. Added \"on-device algorithm development\" to the third bullet point to match the job requirement, and emphasized the ability to work with real-time data and distributed systems.\n\nThese changes should help the resume better align with the job description and highlight the most relevant skills and experiences for the position."
