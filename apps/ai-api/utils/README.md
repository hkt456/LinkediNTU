Parser:

func split_resume_sections:
* Maybe we have to hardcode this list for now, cause all the resume will have the same format and same header
* parsed resume will be stored in processed_resume folder

parse_with_gemini:
* Use gemini to parse the resume from pdf to json format. 
* The result is very promising as the json was well organised and cohesion.
